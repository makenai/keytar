# Security Policy

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING

**KEYTAR HAS NO SECURITY BY DESIGN**

This software is a mock SSO service that intentionally bypasses ALL security measures. It is designed exclusively for local development environments.

## Reporting Security Issues

Since Keytar intentionally has no security features, traditional security vulnerabilities don't apply. However, if you discover:

1. **Unintended network exposure** - Ways the service might accidentally be exposed beyond localhost
2. **Data leakage** - Sensitive information being logged or exposed
3. **Misleading security claims** - Documentation that might imply security where none exists

Please report these issues by:
- Opening an issue on GitHub with the label "safety-concern"
- Clearly marking the issue title with [SAFETY]
- Describing the potential for accidental misuse

## What This Service Does NOT Provide

- ❌ **NO Authentication** - Any user can log in without credentials
- ❌ **NO Authorization** - All permissions are granted to everyone
- ❌ **NO Encryption** - All data transmitted in plain text (except HTTPS)
- ❌ **NO Session Security** - Tokens are predictable and non-revocable
- ❌ **NO Rate Limiting** - Unlimited token generation
- ❌ **NO Audit Logging** - No security events are tracked
- ❌ **NO Input Validation** - Minimal validation of inputs
- ❌ **NO CSRF Protection** - No cross-site request forgery protection
- ❌ **NO XSS Protection** - Limited protection against cross-site scripting

## Intended Use Cases

✅ **ONLY use Keytar for:**
- Local development on developer machines
- CI/CD pipelines in isolated environments
- Integration testing in controlled environments
- Demo environments clearly marked as insecure

## Prohibited Use Cases

❌ **NEVER use Keytar for:**
- Production environments
- Internet-facing services
- Handling real user data
- Any environment with security requirements
- Compliance-regulated environments (HIPAA, PCI, etc.)
- Multi-tenant environments
- Any scenario where actual authentication is needed

## Security Token Markers

All tokens generated by Keytar include a `MOCK_SSO_DEVELOPMENT: true` flag. Any service receiving these tokens should:
1. Reject them in production environments
2. Log warnings when detected
3. Never trust the authentication claims

## If You Accidentally Deployed Keytar to Production

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **SHUT IT DOWN IMMEDIATELY**
2. Assume all authentication is compromised
3. Rotate all credentials and tokens
4. Audit all access logs for the exposure period
5. Notify your security team
6. Consider it a security breach requiring full incident response

## Alternatives for Production

If you need actual security, use:
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) - Full-featured IAM
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) - Cloud authentication
- [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) - Enterprise identity
- [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) - AWS identity service
- [Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) - Microsoft identity

## Contact

For safety concerns only (not feature requests):
- Open a GitHub issue with [SAFETY] tag
- Describe the potential for accidental production use
- Suggest improvements to warnings or documentation

Remember: **This is not a security product. It is an intentionally insecure development tool.**
